## Design Features

The website is made up of 4 pages, the Homepage, Our Products, Workshops and a Contact Us page.

### - Navigation / Header

Featured of all four pages, The navigation bar is situated at the top of the page. In the top left corner is the shorthand name of the company. Once clicked on any of the website pages, this will return the user to the top of the homepage. 
The other navigation links are in the top right corner of the page. For our smaller devices (768px and below) the user will see a stackable menu (burger menu) in the right hand corner of the page. When the user clicks on this, a drop down menu will appear listing Homepage, Our Products, Workshops and a Contact Us page. Each link will navigate the user to the correct page.

For our larger devices (768px and above) the user will see the navigation menu display horizontally at the top of the page.

The navigation has been styled with bakground colour #f3ccd5, the font-family is Amiri and font colour is #000000 which all contrast together nicely. The navigation clearly explains to the user the shorthand name of the company and the different sections within the website making this easy for the user to navigate round.

### Main Section (Homepage)
  The main section is seperated into three parts.  

The first section contains a heading with the name of the company. This is clear and is in a slightly different style to the              navigation bar as to stand out to the user. This heading is used on all four pages of the website and continues the continuity of the     site. The font-style is in oblique and has a font-weight of 700.

The second section contains and image and a caption providing clear information about what the company does and where they source        their materials. The image is to entise the user in and want to look further.

The third section contains an 'about me' and image. The about me gives potential customers an insight as to how the company started,      the passion that has gone into creating the company and hopes to build strong connections with the users.

The main section has been styled with the same font-family, all have been centerally aligned. 

### Footer

Featured on all for four pages, The footer is located at the bottom of the webpage. The footer includes links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube sites for Escape. These links all open on to a new tab. These links are great for encouraging the user to view our site via other social media outlets.

### Our Products Page

The product page contains images and descriptions of the products that are for sale. As part of the description you can see how much the candles/items sell for and what frangrances are available, this is shown in a drop down menu underneath each description. 
This section is valuble to the user as they can see what products are available to them.

### Workshop Page

The workshop page contains images and descpitions of the interactive courses that are available to the user. Each course details the date, approx length of the course, where is it located, the maximum number of people that can attend and the price of the course. This is all important information for the user. Each detail has an icon at the beginning, this provides an easy and effective way to add a visual emphasis for each item.

### Contact Page

The contact page is an interactive way were the user can make contact with the team. Whether that is for further infomation or to request a free brochure and discount code. The user is required to add their first name, last name and email address, if anything is missing the form will not send.
Here there is also a contact address, number and google map to show the user where the headquarters for the company is. 
There are also some icons and descriptions of how the company complies with recycling / animal friendly procucts and reusing products,  which in our current climate of working together to bring the levels of global warning down, is important for the user to see.

### Future Features

* A slideshow of images on the homepage to showcase what we have to offer, to enhance the expirence for the user and increase interest in the page.
* Add reviews from previous clients

### Accessibility

I have run the webpage through Lighthouse on developer tools, these were the results.

### Colour Scheme

These are the colours I chose for the theme, I think the pink and beige compliment each other whilst the black text used for the font stands out.

![Alt text](image-7.png)

### Typography 

I used Google Fonts for my font style. 
For the Main heading I used 'Amiri'
For all other text I used 'IBM Plex Sands'

### Wireframes

For my wireframes I used Balsamiq. This was the first time I has used this programme, and after speaking with my mentor, I realise now that the detail I put into it was to much. I have learnt from this and will reduce how much I include next time, I will also add other size devices to test out my ideas.

## Testing

Throughout the build, I was constanly testing the website. I used Chrome developer tools to troubleshoot any issues I was having. 

The following issue were raised at my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The font size was in px and was reccomended that I use rem.
* Some of my file names were not consistant.
* I had used a lot of ID's and some of these could be changed to a class.
* A color-variable was suggested.

The following items were brought up when I submitted my website to peer code review on Slack:

* On 'Workshop' page, use letter spacing so the text doesnt looked as cramped.
* Page title was a paragraph instead of a 'heading.
* on 'Contact' page the map was partly off the screen and not centered.
* Checked spacing of events as they look a little squashed.

## W3C Validator

I used the W3C Validator to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. I also used CSS Validator to validate the CSS style.css file, i had the following results:

### Credits 

### Content
* All Content was written by myself
* The text throughout the website was taken from Google Fonts.
*	The icons throughout the website was taken from Fontawesome
*	The icon used for the favicon was taken from Flaticon, and I used Favicon to convert the image to a favicon.
* If I needed any assistance with coding, I firstly would google the issue to see if it was something simple that I was missing, I would then look to W3Schools and then reach out on Slack to my fellow students. If all this failed I then contacted the Code Insitute Tutors. 
* When creating the drop down menu, I used the Code Institue slide (in particular the coders coffeehouse slides) to assist me. 
* When creating the form, I used the Code Institute slides (in particular the love running slide) to assist me.  

### Media
*	The images used throughout the website were taken from Pexels, iStockphoto, Freepik and Unsplash
