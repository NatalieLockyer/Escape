Escape Soy Wax Candles and Gifts

Escape Soy Wax Candles and Gifts is a website that is designed to attract any consumer with a love of natural soy wax candles, buying gifts/gift ideas and interactive workshops. This website showcases beautiful images and detailed descriptions of the products available to them and the workshops that are planned for future dates. There is also a “contact us” page, if they required any further information, or would simply like to sign up for a free brochure and discount code off their first order, all of which are useful to the target audience in order to decide as to whether they would like to purchase a gift or workshop package.

  - Navigation Bar (larger devices from 768px and up)
    
  For our larger devices the company name is situated towards the left. As before, when the name is selected it will return the user to     the homepage. 
  As there is more space on this device, the menu list will now be displayed horizontal on the front page as opposed to the menu option.    Each of the headings will be placed next to each other and have a hyperlink to that specific page.
